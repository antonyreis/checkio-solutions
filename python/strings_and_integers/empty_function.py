Keeping in memory your knowledge about variables and operations with them let's make a step aside and talk about functions. Function is a block of code, that may be used multiple times in different places. Usually function gets some input data (parameters), make some operations with them and returns some value outside.

1. In this mission you need to define a function func, which takes no arguments. If you have any trouble, see the hints below the description.

2. Your function is also not going to do anything! To keep a code (expression) working correctly without doing anything you need to use so called placeholders: keyword pass or ... operator.

3. Note that even if a function returns nothing, it returns the empty value None anyway.
